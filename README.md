Recent Searches Display:
The application keeps track of the five most recently searched words and displays them in order, with the most recent at the top. This list updates automatically after each search.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

ðŸ“š How It Works
A user types a word into the search input.
JavaScript makes a request to a dictionary API (e.g., Free Dictionary API).
The response includes the wordâ€™s pronunciation, meaning, part of speech, and example usage.
This data is displayed neatly on the page.
The searched word is added to the recent history list (up to 5 items).

It is ideal for those learning web development and looking to explore DOM manipulation, responsive design, and basic data handling in the browser.
